* Time complexity in union find 
```java
//find the root  O(n) 
    private int find(int n, int[] roots) {
        while (roots[n] != n) {
            n = roots[n]; 
        }
        return n;
    }
// less than O(logn), and close to Constant if compression the path in the find process

    roots[n] = roots[roots[n]];
  
```
