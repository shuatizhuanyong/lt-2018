# Solution - basic

* Basic Union find solution
* Applied HashSet to find out the number of group 

# Solution - 0

* Updated Union Find 
* No UnionFind Class, and only find method, and union logic inside the major function. 
* No HashSet need: maintain a counter -- groups
```java

int pr = find(unions, p);
int qr = find(unions, q);
if (pr != qr) {
    unions[qr] = pr;
    groups--;
}

```

* ranks for union find
