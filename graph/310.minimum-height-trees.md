# Analysis

* Assume no cycle in the graph: when input is :
```
4
[[1,0],[1,2],[2,0]]

```
and No result came out

* if nodes are not connected, which means no root exist for a tree, return []

* input is a edge list

* the MHT roots at least has 2 edges (if n > 2)

* edges == n - 1

* the solution has 1 or 2 nodes could be root

* dfs find deepest path -- not working

# Solution -- basic 

## LTE

* Time Complex: 
```
V == E
O(V) + O(V) + O(V * V)
 
```

# Solution -- 0 

* Basicaly, the leaves only have one edge; bfs traversal from leaves to the inside. Lastly, only two or one nodes left, which is the result.
