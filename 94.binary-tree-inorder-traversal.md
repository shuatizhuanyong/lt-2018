* java collection.addall time complexity: didn't find out precise answer: general speaking, for arraylist.addAll, it should do following operations:
```java
  //1. resize the target array
  //2. copy all elements in 2nd array to target array
  // second step should cost O(O)

``` 
** but for linkedlist.addAll(linkedlist), it should only take O(1) time complexity
** Actually arraylist.addAll(arraylist) got better performance.
