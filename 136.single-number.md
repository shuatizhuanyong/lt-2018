This is the solution i am able to write it done.But take many errors in the process:

1. negative number bit operation:

```java
int n =  -1;
n >> i //(i in [1,31]) all return -1
//so should use:
n / 2 to move right
```
2. need seperated flag to check the number is negative?
3. | and & bit operations:
There is summary: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AOOJXhyQ72ghnNkpUdQNL0HdZZfgLDh42m3HjKtSU_k/edit

bit operation:
```java
int i = -1;
```
