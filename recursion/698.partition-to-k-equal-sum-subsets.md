# Analysis

## input condition:
```
 * 1 <= k <= len(nums) <= 16.

 * 0 < nums[i] < 10000.

```

* 1: total sum should satify total % k != 0, otherwise return false
* 2: calculate group sum, group_sum = total / k
* 3: backtrack find out the elements


## Note:

>> how to backtracking 

## Finally : backtracking is fine, but hashset is slow
