# Solution -- basic -- success

* apply bit as count is basic idea.

* but most people applied int[] for counts

# Solution - 0

* boolean array is still slower


# Solution - 1

* applied int

```
  int is 32 bit
  26 chars only need 26 bit, so int is ok
```
```java

//set 1 in position( chs[j] - 'a')
cnts[i] |= (1 << (chs[j] - 'a'));

// has intersect in 1 or more position 
(cnts[i] & cnts[j]) != 0

```
