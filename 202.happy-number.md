### Straforward solution:
* Solution - 0
using a set/map to keep mid result. if the result comes out again, return false. Otherwise, keep going, until result == 1 or it was found happen before.

But Space complexity is O(n)

* Solution - 1
There is anther solution only cost O(1) space. the idea is similar to fast/slow point solution for determining whether cycle existed in graph.
