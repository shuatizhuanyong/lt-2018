# Solution  basic

* tc : O(logn) + O(2 * log(n - 1)) + .... O( 2^log(n - 1) * 1 )



# Solution -- 0

* tc : looks like O(logn ^ 2)



# Solution  --test 
confused the following code :
```java
            if (node.val != -100) {
                node.val = -100;
              ...  
```
which will effect the performance a lot, not sure the reason




# Time complexity
Looks like O(log(n) ^ 2) -- height solution

O(n) -- bfs solution
