# Solution - basic


# Tricky question for me

# with classic solution, we can start from comparing val[mid] and target

# it works, but need secondery condition check where the rotation is. -- became relative complicated



# Solution - 0

# inside logic, check left --> mid is ordered.
# if yes => if target whether in [left, mid) 
## if yes right = mid - 1;
## if no left = mid + 1;

# if no => check target whether in (mid, right]
## if yes, left = mid + 1;
## if no, right = mid - 1;
