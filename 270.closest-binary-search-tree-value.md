# Solution - basic

* inorder to get values as a list firstly, then binary search to find the value first
* Time complexity: O(n) + O(logn)
* Space complexity: O(n)

* Summary: unnecessary complicated



# Solution - 0

* recursively range filter the closest value: need to maintain the current largest value, smallest value.

* Time : avg: O(h), worest: O(n), best: O(1)
* Space : avg: O(h), worest: O(n), best: O(1) -- recursive call space
* Summary: meanwhile maintain closest large, closest small value is not the best solution


# Solution - 1 & 2

* came from others': idea is same, recursive & loop
* the idea is like binary search, each time we know the current node > or < the target, if >, the possible result must be itself or left subtree. 

* Time/Space is the same to the previous
