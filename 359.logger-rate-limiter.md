### question is easy, but it's a good question to follow up

1. if message is a object or with structure 
      md5 as a key may be ok

2. lots of request with different key
    more than one process to handle different key or distrubited map: and inside, to prevent exception, the map need to lock to access 

3. long time passed, the capcity of map? 
  need a queue to store last successful keys
  if each time to check, need to check the timestamp of last key in the queue, if it is exceed 10s. delete the key and the value in map
